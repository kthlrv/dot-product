## Project Specifications

Write the kernel in (1) C program and (2) an x86-64 assembly language. The kernel is to perform a dot product between vector A and vector B and place the result in _sdot_.

**Input**: Scalar variable `n` (integer) contains the length of the vector; Vectors A and B are both **single-precision float**. Scalar _sdot_ is a single-precision float.

**Process**: $sdot = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}b_{i} = a_{1}b_{1} + a_{2}b_{2} + ... + a_{n}b_{n}$

**Output**: Store the result in memory location sdot. Display the result for all versions of the kernel (i.e., C and x86-64).
